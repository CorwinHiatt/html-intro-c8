</h1>


<body>
   <h2> Content of the website... </h2>
  <h3> the is is a continuation of content...</h3>
  and again...
  <p>this is a paragraph i can indent and it will not make a difference because html doesn't 
    see things like this, </p>
    <br>so no I put a (br) in  and it creates the
    space in the paragraph
